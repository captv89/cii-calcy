	<h1>What is the CII?</h1>

	<p>
		The CII (Carbon Intensity Indicator) is a measure for a ship’s energy efficiency and is given in
		grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity and nautical mile. Vessels receive an
		environmental rating of A (major superior), B (minor superior), C (moderate), D (minor
		inferior), or E (inferior performance level). The rating thresholds become increasingly
		stringent towards 2030.
	</p>
	<p>
		Starting in 2024, the CII must be calculated and reported to the Data Collection System (DCS)
		verifier together with the aggregated DCS data for the previous year. The attained annual
		operational CII and the environmental rating (A to E) will be noted on the DCS Statement of
		Compliance (SoC), which must be kept on board for five years.
	</p>
	<p>
		The CII is calculated based on the formula: grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity and
		nautical mile. Correction factors and voyage adjustments can be applied for special design and
		operational circumstances.
